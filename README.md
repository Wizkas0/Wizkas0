### Hi!
My name is Kalle and I am a 5th year M.Sc. Computer Science student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). My specialization is software technology, but I'm also very interested in cyber security.

### Some Projects
Here are some open source projects that I have worked on:

[Who Be That Pokémon](https://github.com/vickstrom/whobethatpokemon)
A game where you can put your poké-knowledge to the test against your friends by correctly guessing the pokémon based on it's outline. Created with Firebase, React and PokeAPI.

[Repo Score](https://github.com/Wizkas0/repo-score)
A customizable github action and framework which allows you to keep and automatically update a score-board for contributors to your repository. The scoreboard integrates with your custom scoring actions and updates based on your custom ruleset.

[Pull Request Label Generator](https://github.com/Wizkas0/PR-LabelGenerator)
Another customizable github action which automatically labels pullrequests made to your repository based on your allowed labels.
